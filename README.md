## PapiOphidian
Just some 19 year old independent full stack developer. I started developing in JavaScript (cjs) on 01/20/2017.
Since then, I can safely say that I know:
- JavaScript (cjs & esm)
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Java
- Python

I am also rather proficient in:
- Writing documentation
- Regular expressions
- Debugging and fixing abnormal process memory usage
