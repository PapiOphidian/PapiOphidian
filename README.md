## PapiOphidian
Just some 21 year old independent full stack developer. I started off with Node.js on 01/20/2017.
Since then, I can safely say that I know:
- JavaScript (CommonJS & ESModule) (Node & WebJS)
- TypeScript
- MD, HTML, Pug, CSS/SCSS
- Some Java
- Some Python
- Some Rust

I am also proficient in:
- Writing regular expressions
- Adapting existing applications to make use of multi-threaded workloads / micro services
- WebSocket server & client

I like to write core frameworks & API wrappers with a side of web scraping.
