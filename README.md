## PapiOphidian
Just some 20 year old independent full stack developer. I started off with JavaScript (CommonJS) on 01/20/2017.
Since then, I can safely say that I know:
- JavaScript (CommonJS & ESModule)
- TypeScript
- Some front end such as MD, HTML & Pug plus CSS & SCSS
- Java
- Python
- Rust

I am also rather proficient in:
- Manual documentation
- Regular expressions
- Multi-threaded workloads / micro services
- WebSocket gateway server & client

I like to write core frameworks & API wrappers with a side of web scraping.
